/* App.css - Use sparingly when working with Tailwind */

/* This file can be used for very broad, application-wide styles
   that are not easily handled by Tailwind utility classes directly
   on components. For example, custom scrollbar styles, or very
   specific global resets not covered by Tailwind's base. */

/* Example: Smooth scrolling for the entire page */
html {
  scroll-behavior: smooth;
}

/* Example: A very basic container style if you had one */
/* .container {
  max-width: 1200px;
  margin: 0 auto;
  padding: 1rem;
} */

/* Avoid adding styles here that you can achieve with Tailwind classes
   in your React components (e.g., colors, spacing, typography, flexbox). */
